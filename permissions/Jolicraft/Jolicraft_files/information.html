<td>My name is Jolicoeur, so I called it Jolicraft. It's pronounced 
"Jolly Craft" by the way. My name means "Happy Heart", so I guess 
Jolicraft means "Happy Craft". So maybe I should have called it 
HappyCraft, because I'm generally quite happy. But I'm not always happy.
 Sometimes I run out of wine. Sometimes there's no hot water for my 
bath. Sometimes when I'm changing my son's diaper, he pees on me.<br><br>
Minecraft is a game about crafting the world around you. What better way
 to craft the world than to craft the very stuff the world is made of? I
 had a great time creating Jolicraft, it's so addictive to create 
textures and see them live in your own world. I didn't really intend to 
push the pack as far as I did, but damn this shit is addictive. It's as 
addictive as Minecraft itself, which is saying alot. <br><br>

<b><span style="font-size: 18px;">Flavours:</span></b><br>

<!--<img src="images/info_advancedinstall.png" align="right" />
<b><span style="font-size: 18px;">Advanced Installation:</span></b><br>
<b>1.</b> Jolicraft comes with a bunch of extra features included, like custom sky and fog colours, custom animated water and lava, and random mob variations, and more. You can enable all these features by downloading a program called MCPatcher to patch your game. Once you patch, these features will work right away, no extra work needed.<br>
<b>2.</b> Download the latest version of MCPatcher from the official forum thread here (scroll down to the 'downloads' section): <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1496369-12w38b-132-125-etcupdate-921-mcpatcher-hd-fix-24/">http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1496369-12w38b-132-125-etcupdate-921-mcpatcher-hd-fix-24/</a><br>
<b>3.</b> Run MCPatcher. It will automatically fill in all the important stuff, like selecting your minecraft folder and enabling most features. From this main screen you can enable "Bettergrass", "Random Mobs", and "Custom Colors". Click the "Patch" button. It will Patch. Then, exit MCPatcher and start up Minecraft with much more custom Jolicraft goodness.<br>
<b>4.</b> This is the quick verison of how to install. If things go wrong or if you have any problems with MCPatcher, VISIT THE MCPATCHER THREAD for more detailed instrucitons and support. (aka, don't ask me how to do stuff, please)<br>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Why did you make this 16x16? Wouldn't it be awesomer if it was 32x32 or 128x128 or 1080x1080?</b><br>
I love 16p texture packs. It seems the perfect resolution to match the 
style of Minecraft. The purposefully crude low-res pixel crafting nature
 of the game was simply made for 16x16 textures, anything more just 
feels weird - like drinking red wine while eating hotdogs. Which Notch 
does every morning at the breakfast table. Pixels are beautiful my 
friend, and in a grid of 16x16 they're damn near perfection. <br><br>

<b>Can you please add more sidegrass?</b><br>
Let me explain why this is almost no sidegrass on Jolicraft dirt. I like
 sidegrass in many texture packs. Sometimes it works and looks great for
 the type of grass &amp; dirt they've created. But Jolicraft dirt is 
different. It's firm and scoopable. The grass is a thin layer on top of 
the dirt, so more sidegrass makes no sense as it either makes the grass 
layer feel thicker than I want or it makes the thin grass all droopy. 
Think of my dirt like cake with icing on top, so when you scoop through 
it the grass doesn't instantly hang down the side, it stays firm. And 
the grass overhangs just a tiny bit to cast a slight shadow down the 
side of the dirt. It's that crisp edge that makes Jolicraft dirt 
different from other dirt. It's not that I'm against sidegrass in 
general, just sidegrass in Jolicraft.<br><br>

<b>I asked you to change a texture and you didn't. What gives?</b><br>
I'm sorry. You had good intentions in suggesting a change, but I didn't 
care for it. Don't be angry! I don't care for lots of stuff that other 
people like. And I care for lots of things that other folk don't like. 
And I'm neutral to things that many people aren't neutral to. What a 
world! Does that answer your question?<br><br>

<b>Why don't you use ad.fly to make money off Jolicraft?</b><br>
I've been asked this many times. I just don't want to. Jolicraft is just
 a personal project for me, it's my pleasure to make textures, to make 
them available for everyone, and have fun doing it. All I ask is that 
you keep a place for Jolicraft in your heart, and spread the news.<br><br>

<b>I'm making my own pack or map, and I want to use a texture from your pack. Can I?</b><br>
I get lots of requests from folks asking if they can use specific 
textures in their packs and maps. I don't mind if you use any of my 
textures, help yourself and enjoy! But I just ask that if you do use 
something I've made that you state somewhere in your thread what you 
used of mine, and include a link to jolicraft.com or my thread via the 
Jolicraft logo (http://www.jolicraft.com/images/logo.png). And I 
STRONGLY encourage you to not rely on anything I've made. Making a few 
textures doesn't take long. It's much more satisfying to create 
something original than to rely on someone else's creations. Wouldn't 
you agree?<br><br>

<b>What's wrong with you?</b><br>
Once when I was young I pushed a toothpick into my ear and it went all 
the way in and didn't come out. I've not been quite right since then.
